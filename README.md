# Kattis-Programming-Challenges

Solution for a Kattis programming challenge I made as part of the application to my software developer internship at Tink. We got three problems. One easy, one medium, one hard. Here you can see my solution to the hard problem.

Since it was part of an application, I can't access the problem formulation any more. But task was to make a program that would, for a given number N between 1 and 10 000, return the last 3 digits in N! (faculty) that were not zero. For example if N=10 (N!=3628800) you would return 288. For the solution there was a time constraint as well as memory costraint.

This is much harder than it seems at first glance (you can try if you want). You need to think about how zeros are created in a faculty and use prime factorization solve the task.
